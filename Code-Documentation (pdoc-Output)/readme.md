# Code Documentation

In the file `code_documenter.html.txt` is stored a forme result of the execution of pdoc to analyze the script (`code_documenter.py`).

The extension has been modified manually to `txt` instead of html so that GitHub does not recognize and count it for the percentage of the programming language of this repository, as it is only a helper.

If you need the file, you can change the extension back to ``html.``

**NOTE: **
This file is not up to date necessarily, so please make sure, to run pdoc again, if you need it.
